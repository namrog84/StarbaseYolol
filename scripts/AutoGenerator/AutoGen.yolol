:FuelChamberUnitRateLimit=(10000-:StoredBatteryPower)/10 GOTO1

// Linear ramps with battery.
// if battery is at 10,000, then fuel chamber rate limit is 0
// if battery is at 0, then fuel chamber rate limit is 100 (max)

// If you want to maintain full charge, this isn't the script for you
// It doesn't handle high burst activities as well as some others.
// you might want a MinEPS (Minimum Energy Per Second) button.
